    <div class="content">
      <p>
        The journey of our project began with a detailed planning session, where
        we laid out the project’s goals, assigned tasks, and decided on the
        tools and technologies we would use. The primary objective was to create
        an interactive website, which would involve not only technical
        development but also collaboration and coordination among team members.
        Throughout this process, we made use of several tools for design,
        development, and collaboration, which helped shape this project. This
        report summarizes our approach, the challenges faced, and the lessons
        learned during the course of the project.
      </p>
      <h2>Design and planning phase</h2>
      <p>
        We started by focusing on the design of the website, as this would lay
        the foundation for the development phase. Figma, a user interface design
        tool, was our primary tool for creating wireframes and visual designs of
        the website pages. Using Figma allowed us to experiment with different
        layout, user flow, and interactions, which ultimately helped in refining
        the overall look and feel of the website. In parallel, we used Coolers,
        an online color scheme generator, to ensure the design adhered to an
        aesthetically pleasing and consistent palette.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once we had a clear design in place, we divided the workload. Each team
        member was responsible for developing one page of the website based on
        the design they had worked on. This approach allowed us to break down
        the project into manageable sections and ensured that everyone had a
        specific area of responsibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        We made an intentional decision to start working on the project early.
        By doing so, we ensured that there were sufficient time for revisions
        and addressing any unforeseen issues. This proactive approach also gave
        us room for feedback and provided time to refine our work through
        multiple rounds of revisions.
      </p>
      <h2>Development phase</h2>
      <p>
        For the development of the website, we relied on several key tools and
        technologies:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span>VSCode </span>was the code editor of choice for all team
          members. This tool provided essential features like syntax
          highlighting, version control integration, and extensions for
          debugging, making coding more efficient and error-free.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>Git </span>was used for version control, which helped us manage
          and track changes to the codebase. By using Git, we were able to
          easily collaborate and merge our work without issues.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>GitHub </span>was our platform for storing and sharing code. It
          allowed for real-time collaboration and code reviews, it also acted as
          a backup for our work. The GitHub repository enabled us to easily keep
          track of changes, resolve issues, and manage different versions of the
          project.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The website itself eas built using <b>HTML, CSS,</b> and
        <b>JavaScript.</b> HTML provided the structure of the web pages, CSS was
        used to style pages and make them visually appealing, and JavaScript
        allowed us to add interactivity. We also gained basic exposure to
        working with APIs to fetch dynamic content from external sources and
        integrate them into websites, enhancing the overall functionality.
      </p>
      <p>
        the development phase, we also used GitHub’s issue tracker to document
        and prioritize bugs, features, and other tasks. This helped keep the
        project organized and ensured that we stayed on track to meet deadlines.
      </p>
      <h2>Challenges Faced</h2>
      <p>Despite our early start, we faced challenges:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span>Learning Curve: </span>Not all team memberswerefamiliar with
          tools like Git ang API integeration, requiring extra time for
          self-learning.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>Time Management: </span>Balancing the project with academic
          responsibilities was difficult, leading to occasional delays.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>Team Attendances: </span>Not everyone could attend every
          meeting, causing communication gaps and slow progress.
        </li>
      </ul>
